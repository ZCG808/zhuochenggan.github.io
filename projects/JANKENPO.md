The goal of this project was to provide ICS 211 students with a first-time experience with Java GUI framework and coding interactive programs. The skills involved were GUI design and Java Backend Programming. The game itself is pretty self-explanatory to those who have played ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR before, but for those who haven't heard of this game before, there is a help page showcasing the rules. 

I coded out the entire game from a design standpoint all the way to product deployment, it was fascinating as it was my first ever experience of full-on software development. 

This project allowed me to understand the functioning of a software development team, where the front-end engineer has to collab with the back-end engineer to create functional software. Going through the full process of developing a mini-game also allowed me to understand the work that goes into different aspects of software. Each button itself could require an entire algorithm to make it optimal performance.
