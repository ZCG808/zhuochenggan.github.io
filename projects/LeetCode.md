This is an ongoing preparation, where I would try to do one problem per day during beaks and 2-3 problems per week during the school year. These problems focus ranges from the data structure, algorithm design, complexity optimization dynamic programming, etc. It covers problems that combine many needed skills of a software engineer, and its huge problem libraries also support many different languages and fields of Computer Science. 

Currently, I'm focused on utilizing Java to solve a problem involving data structure, algorithms, and dynamic programming in the most optimal way. As my skills become more fluent in these focuses, I would like to expand my portfolio into databases and Python problem-solving. 

Going through leetcode exercises helps me to keep my coding skills active and expand my knowledge of algorithm design, it also pushes me to find the most optimal solution. I would often face similar problems as many software engineers, such as the tradeoff between time complexity and space complexity, and that is with user responsiveness and experience in consideration.
