<p><strong>Software Engineering Questions</strong></p>

<p>Asking smart questions is considered a key skill for any job profession including Software Engineer. In daily life, we often encounter problems that we are not knowledgeable about or have the resources to solve. This is often the time we ask others for help and this is when asking smart questions plays a key role. By asking smart questions, the other party will be more willing to help you because they feel you have put in a great amount of effort and are respected by asking them for help. Additionally, specifically in the Software Engineering field, a lot of the technical questions often require unique debugging skills and knowledge. When we aren’t equipped with those attributes, we often go on platforms such as Stackoverflow, ChatGPT, and Google for help.</p>

<p>Stackoverflow, ChatGPT and Google are often programmer best friends, but in order to get help from those platforms, it requires us programmers to give a precise and answerable prompt. Other than a precise prompt, giving as much detail as possible will be crucial, such as your experience when facing this problem and applicable information.</p>

<p><strong>Good Questions?</strong></p>

<p>In my personal opinion, a good question is one like the following: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10982941/java-synchronization-not-working-as-expected">Stackoverflow</a>. I consider this question to be a smart question because the question is clear and the user tries to post as much detail as possible. For example, users explain their logic by expressing their reasoning behind why “Broke Synchronization” should never be printed. Upon finding a valid solution, the user edits the post and shows the most helpful feedback he received, that way people who face such error in the future will have an easier time finding solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Bad Questions?</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, here is a question that I think is not as perfect: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35269179/angular-conditional-class-with-ngclass">Stackoverflow</a>. User posted his code and a simple question about why the code isn’t working, also upon many solutions posted, the post never got edited with the best feedback. Simply posting your code and asking why it isn’t working will not always work, and often others have a harder time trying to understand what your question is. By explaining your own logic and possible solutions, it allows the helper to better understand the bug and when facing a more difficult problem, this method will increase efficiency significantly</p>
