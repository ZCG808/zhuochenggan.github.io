**Estimates & Experiences**

Prior to this assignment, I have no prior knowledge of tracking time on task completion but I tried to make a generous estimate and reserve that time period to allow myself completing such a task. Prior experience of writing code for different prompt also played an role into making these time estimate. Some challenges I face is to give estimate on task that I'm not familiar with, such as utilizing google api for model page and AI chat creation, these features require in depth research and I had no clue how long it was gonna take me, but it turns out my generous time estimate was quite enough.

**Benefit of Time Estimate**

Time estimate is a great way to keep yourself on track of completing an project and reserving an appropriate amount of time for each task. Specially for a University student, time management is a must need when you have multiple classes to work on and clearing up enough time for each task of your project will be key to ensure progress.

***Benefit of Time Tracking***

Although time tracking might just seem like some time data but it can be very helpful to be referenced in the future. With prior data, you can see your progress of problems solving skills and when asked to give a deadline for a task you are assigned to. You can reference to prior work to give a accurate deadline to ensure productivity!

***Final project***

Through this process of tracking i mainly used the stopwatch from google search and also the time on my devices. My data should be quite accurate, if were to give a number I would say it is 80% accurate. This is because sometimes I would brainstorm on a problem when I'm driving, walking or just sitting down and don't have the luxury to time.
