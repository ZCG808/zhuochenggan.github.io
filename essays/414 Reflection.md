**Introduction**

Through the entire semester of ICS 414, We've been assigned with an preset team and a project to work on. The project consists of creating an volunteer platform that provides various functionality ranges from activity display, user interaction, notification and etc. 

**Personal Experience with project**

This was my first time working on an software project in an semester team settings and it introduced me to many new skills. Such as familiarity with github, utilizing pull request, merge, project management and team communication. At the same time I also learned many more technical implementation such as production level database, mailbox notification, role based access control and etc.

**Issues Faced & Suggestion**

-   ***Technical Implementation***: Throughout the entire project, we are asked to implement a lot of features that we have never coded before. Therefore when it comes to implementing such features, it would require extensive research and learning.
- ***Team communication***: As a team that consists of multiple members, personal conflict often arises that affects project's progress. Also sometime one's functionality also relies on other implementation so communication is key to ensure smooth progress. 
- ***Role assigning***: Although through this project, we did not assign specific role for each member, but this is something I would consider assigning more specific role therefore we can utilized each member's strength to the fullest. 
- ***Project Management***: Another good practice would be to have a project manager that is responsible for coordinating time, task, and communication to ensure project is up to expected progress.

**Conclusion**

Overall this was an great experience and helped me to vastly improve my technical web programming skills and understanding an team project environment. The issues and lesson learned through this project experience will be a great asset for my future software engineering work.
