**Thoughts**

Wow, Just went through my first-ever in-class WOD! The process of preparing for this exercise felt very similar to preparing for a technical interview, where you try to solve a coding problem given to you in a limited amount of time. I felt like such an exercise has pushed my knowledge of Javascript as it requires a full understanding of that weekâ€™s material. Performing the WOD in class, prepares me for real-world software engineering, as it solidifies our foundation in Javascript and improves our problem-solving in terms of algorithm designs. 

**Reflection**

Oh man, doing the WOD certainly brings back a familiar feeling. Its style of athletic software engineering felt very similar to the technical interview questions. You are given a limited amount of time to design an algorithm to solve a specific problem, and due to time constraints, you might not always find the most optimal solution. I find such a style of learning to be enjoyable as I would often try solving similar problems on leetcode via Java. Not only is it an enjoyable style of learning, but it is also a beneficial one, such pressure and time constraints will require you to be well-familiarized with the material.
