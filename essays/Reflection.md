**Javascript related to Java?**

Java is by far my most expert programming language, so naturally, when I saw the Javascript language, it triggered me to question its similarity. Upon learning Javascript, I was amazed by how smooth the transition was from Java’s syntax to Javascript’s syntax. To me, Javascript looked more like a simplified version of Java that serves a different purpose, or a cross-invention by combining Java and Python syntaxes. But as I dive deeper into Javascript, I find it to be completely different, although it shares many similarities with Java, much of its design is used to serve the purpose of web development’s convenience. From a software engineering perspective, I find Javascript to be an excellent language, as it provides the needed tools for web development such as dynamically typed, browser native, large selection of libraries and frameworks.

*Athletic software engineering? Technical Interview? Leetcode?*

Oh man, doing the WOD certainly brings back a familiar feeling. Its style of athletic software engineering felt very similar to the technical interview questions. You are given a limited amount of time to design an algorithm to solve a specific problem, and due to time constraints, you might not always find the most optimal solution. I find such a style of learning to be enjoyable as I would often try solving similar problems on leetcode via Java. Not only is it an enjoyable style of learning, but it is also a beneficial one, such pressure and time constraints will require you to be well-familiarized with the material.
