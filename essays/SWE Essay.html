<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>This past semester was an accomplishing and meaningful experiences for me. I was able to step outside of my comfort zone and compete in the HACC as a solo team, and designing an project that I’m proud of. If one was to tell me the level of web development skill I could achieve at the beginning of the semester, I would have not believed it. The skills that were taught in ICS 314 goes beyond web development, it taught me how to be a better software engineer, communicator, programmer and professional. A good example of skills outside of pure web development is Open source software development, development environment, user interface frameworks, project management and etc.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source Software Development</strong></p>

<p>Open sourcing your project is a great way to display any project you have worked on, it allows others to view your code and potentially contribute to your project. You can also display your skill sets and knowledge in your portfolio via such projects,  attracting interest from public community. Additionally, open source software in general allows programmers to improve together. For those who are newbie, looking at open source project allows them to acquire unique skills!</p>

<p><strong>Development Environment</strong></p>

<p>Having a good development environment is a key essentials for any programmer, it allows you to code efficiently and effectively. One of the biggest tools that I acquire throughout this semester is Github, it allows for better project management and collaborative programming. Using github is also a great way to showcase open source software. To continue with, having a modern IDE is also crucial for any programmer, it allows for better coding experiences and IDE like Intellij allows you to add plug ins for one’s customization.</p>

<p><strong>User Interface Frameworks</strong></p>

<p>Utilizing user interface frameworks is a great way to boost one’s development efficiency and allows for better user experience. Nowadays, majority of UI are done through some sorts of framework and in ICS 314 specifically, we used framework such as React, Bootstrap and Meteor for full stack platforms. It provides convenience and unlimited development potentials for newbies or experienced programmers.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Project Management</strong></p>

<p>A key skills to be acquired by any programmer or Software Engineers is project management. At some point in our career, we will be working in teams to tackle on bigger projects. However, when it comes to managing these situations it tends to be a bit hectic. In ICS 314, I experienced project management through the final project and the HACC, coordinating time, task and communication is a key aspect of a successful project. Such experience allows me to be more prepared for future projects and a team player.</p>
