<p>The goal of this project was to provide ICS 211 students with a first-time experience with Java GUI framework and coding interactive programs. The skills involved were GUI design and Java Backend Programming. The game itself is pretty self-explanatory to those who have played ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR before, but for those who havenâ€™t heard of this game before, there is a help page showcasing the rules.</p>

<p>I coded out the entire game from a design standpoint all the way to product deployment, it was fascinating as it was my first ever experience of full-on software development. Many skills were involved throughout this process, as at first we would have to come up with a general framework to work on, then continue with designing buttons and grids. Once the entire front end has been completed, we have to start backend development to ensure all buttons are interactive and functioning</p>

<p>This project allowed me to understand the functioning of a software development team, where the front-end engineer has to collab with the back-end engineer to create functional software. Going through the full process of developing a mini-game also allowed me to understand the work that goes into different aspects of software. Each button itself could require an entire algorithm to make it optimal performance.</p>
