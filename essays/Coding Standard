Coding Standards? Grammars? 
Throughout a programmer’s education and career, one often has to review their previous code or share code with collaborators. In these situations, we often want our code’s readability to be clear and precise, this applies to any previous note-taking you have taken in your class or any information your professors are passing down to you. Often you want information or code to be easily understandable, in programming, we enforces such standard by having Coding Standards. Coding standards are like grammar for writing an essay or paper, it is enforced to keep information neat, and understandable and remove any unnecessary info.

Eslint
Through the past week, I’ve been introduced to a new set of standards using Javascript called Eslint. This specific standard pointed out a lot of bad habits I developed from previous coding experiences. After pushing myself for a week to adjust to such a standard, I noticed my code become a lot more cleaner and readable. Additionally, one of the most useful features I’ve found is acknowledging unused variables or functions, this reminds you to remove unnecessary data, and function, or create test cases to put functions in use. 

Downside of Eslint
Lastly, after mentioning so many benefits of coding standards and Eslint, what are some downsides of Eslint? From my experience, when trying to code in a timely matter such as Athletic Software Engineering, I often have to distinguish between coding standard errors and syntax errors, having this red error all over my screen was an unpleasant experience, there are some weak warnings that aren’t applicable during some of my coding processes. In general, coding standards are a great way to make our code readable and fixable, all the downsides I’ve mentioned can all be fixed with practices with such standards.
