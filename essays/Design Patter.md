*What is design patterns?*

In Software Engineering, design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly experienced problems. It allows for usability, and development efficiency and provides a reliable foundation to start your projects. Although it is not a section of code you can directly implement into your project like many famous algorithms or searches out there. It provides a roadmap and recipe while designing your project, Design patterns can be broken down into 3 categories: creational, structural, and behavioral. Creational patterns relate to object creation, structural patterns deal with the relationship between those objects and lastly, behavioral patterns are responsible for the use of those objects. In general, design patterns are invaluable to creating clean, reliable, and scalable Software projects.

*Use of Design Pattern In My Projects*

Many programmer are not aware of their use of design patterns before learning the concepts of it. Prior to ICS 314, I was not aware of the idea of design patterns and after learning about the concepts, I recall utilizing such strategy in many of my coding projects. For example, multi-thread is a common technique used in Java programs to boost up efficiency of programs but this comes at a cost, the possibility of race-conditions. When multiple threads are accessing a single resource or object, the order of access can be varied causing unexpected results for the programmer. So what is a solution? Implementing a lock on the object or resources to allow only one access at a time would be an ideal solution for such a problem, and what Iâ€™ve just described in an example of the singleton design pattern. Singleton design patterns are widely used in Software Engineering projects to ensure expected results, most of the time design patterns are not required in your projects. However, utilizing design patterns can be the best practice and provide useful functions for a successful project.


*Conclusion*

In conclusion, a design pattern is key to building successful projects and allows common techniques shared between different developments. Projects range from different languages and purposes, but it's common implementation can be defined as a design pattern. For example, a singleton strategy can be implemented for threads in Java, a web manager in Javascript, and AI modification in Pythons. It greatly enhances the performance and quality of any software project and is a must-know for any Software Engineer.
