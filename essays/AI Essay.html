<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>AI has become one of the foundational tools in Education and Software Engineering, it’s capability of answering a question precisely and timely has been a key aspect of it’s popularity. In education, it assists student in off-class hours and allow student learn new material outside of classes. On the other hand, in industry it provides debugging help, syntax check and information library for Software Engineers. I personally used ChatGPT as my primary source of AI help and resource.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Experience with AI</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Experience WODs e.g. E18</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In-class Practice WODs</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>In-class WODs</em></strong></p>

<p>I personally find AI not as helpful on WOD in general, the time limit itself restricts the conversation you can have and without knowledge in the material of the WOD, it often result in a DNF WOD completions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Essays</em></strong></p>

<p>AI isn’t too useful for essay either, as in this class essay is just a way to express our experience and often requires little to none technical competence.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final project</em></strong></p>

<p>I find myself using AI a lot for the final project, it is the quickest way for me to test out my idea and explore new knowledge needed for the project. For example. I would find myself asking what are some good tools for a specific task or if I want to achieve a certain ideas, how should I approach it?</p>

<p><strong><em>Learning a concept / tutorial</em></strong></p>

<p>I find AI very useful in learning a concept as it gives a direct answer instead of the need of browning through different webpages or tutorials. AI is also very customizable when learning a concept, a good example of this would be asking compatible libraries for a specific task using the meteor systems. The lack of online documentation on meteor will make this task very hard to research about plainly on the web.</p>

<p><strong><em>Answering a question in class or in Discord</em></strong></p>

<p>I personally don’t use AI to answer question in class or discord, as I find the question in class to be more discussion questions that requires more personal knowledge or thoughts than a correct answers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Asking or answering a smart-question</em></strong></p>

<p>I personally won’t answer any question that I’m not confidently knowledge in so using AI wouldn’t be a choice of mines. As for asking a smart-question, if I don’t know something i wouldn’t ask AI make it sounds smarter which might make it more confusing for the answering person.</p>

<p><strong><em>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”</em></strong></p>

<p>I do find above example to be helpful, even during the Underscore module, I would ask AI to give me a example for a specific function and also return with my understanding to check if it is correct.</p>

<p><strong><em>Explaining code</em></strong></p>

<p>This is one of this strong area of AI, since it’s explanation is adjustable base on your needs and provides a lot of personable examples instead of hard text explanation. I find myself using AI a lot to explain certain use of Code and it often net a positive result.</p>

<p><strong><em>Writing code</em></strong></p>

<p>I find AI written code to be great for educational purpose, expecting it to provide a full on solution on a complex program will be extremely difficult. For example, if I’m using meteor and I want to write some pages it will need to connect dot with other code such as api, components and etc but AI does not have access to that.</p>

<p><strong><em>Documenting code</em></strong></p>

<p>I personally don’t use AI to document code at all, since documenting code is often for the purpose of reviewing code later on and understanding it. If  I wrote some code, I would document it in a way it will be easy for me to understand and AI does not provide that capabilities.</p>

<p><strong><em>Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code code here” or “Fix the ESLint errors in code here”</em></strong></p>

<p>This is one of the strong area of AI, debugging code and fixing syntax errors, it save developer so much time trying to hunt down a missing semi colon or bracket.</p>

<p><strong><em>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</em></strong></p>

<p>N/A</p>

<p><strong>Impact on Learning and Understanding</strong></p>

<p>Incorporation of AI have boosted my efficiency in learning new material as it provide one direct stop on getting information and personalize explanation. Although it doesn’t provide the most in-depth solution, it’s 24/7 availability and detail oriented solution has benefited me a lot as a student and developer.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Applications</strong></p>

<p>For my HACC project, I’ve also incorporate the use of AI including a AI generated Image function and using ChatGPT for idea exploration and tools recommendation. AI might be helpful in assisting writing real-world application code but relying on it to write majority of the production would be extremely diffcult.</p>

<p><strong>Challenge and Opportunities</strong></p>

<p>Within the course, use of AI was more for off-class researching and understanding the material. For any in class assignments or WOD, I find it not as useful as we can get help directly from the Professor and WOD are timed, so there is lack of time to utilize AI in exploration for an answer.</p>

<p><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Traditional teaching methods and Ai enhanced approaches shares a lot of similarity, as AI are mostly trained on human data to educate user on certain topic. But the traditional teaching methods provides a teaching styles that consists of less error, a lot of the time AI contains error in its response as it is requires to provide a timely response time. As for traditional teaching, a lot of the time teaching material are well prepared in advance and expert level teacher are assigned to teach such subject.</p>

<p><strong>Future Considerations</strong></p>

<p>I believe AI is here to stay and the development of such technology will not only advance the speed of improvement in Software Engineering, but also in other academic fields. At the same time, AI is also facing a loads of challenges such as data ethics, bias fairness, security and etc. There will be many challenges and questions raised as the development of AI improves.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe AI is a great toolset when used the proper way, over-relying on the use of AI will result in lack of self-improvement and understanding of materials. AI when used properly can create another workforce revolution where everybody in the society is able to move on from low-mid level jobs onto higher level jobs. It can be implemented into robotics, automation, research and etc, these are extremely beneficial to the society and not only to the world of Software Engineering.</p>
