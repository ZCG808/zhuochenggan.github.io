**Introduction**

During the semester-long ICS 414 course, my team and I were assigned a project to create a volunteer platform with features such as activity displays, user interactions, and notifications. This platform served as an excellent exercise for learning how to collaborate effectively, developing new technical skills, and navigating challenges that naturally arise when working with a team.

**Personal Experience with project**

This was my first experience working on a software project in a semester-long team setting. It introduced me to new skills, like version control with GitHub, creating and managing pull requests, project management, and team communication. Technically, I also learned to implement features like production-level databases, mailbox notifications, and role-based access control.

**Issues Faced & Suggestion**

-   ***Technical Implementation***: We were required to implement many unfamiliar features, necessitating extensive research and learning. A more structured approach to exploring new technologies and features could have streamlined this process.
- ***Team communication***: With a team of multiple members, personal conflicts occasionally hindered progress, and sometimes dependencies between different features made communication essential. Establishing a more structured communication protocol would help ensure smoother progress.
- ***Role assigning***: Although through this project, we did not assign specific role for each member, but this is something I would consider assigning more specific role therefore we can utilized each member's strength to the fullest. 
- ***Project Management***: Another good practice would be to have a project manager that is responsible for coordinating time, task, and communication to ensure project is up to expected progress.

**Conclusion**

Overall, this project was a valuable experience that greatly improved my technical web programming skills and introduced me to the dynamics of working within a team project environment. The challenges faced and lessons learned during this project will be invaluable in my future software engineering endeavors.
