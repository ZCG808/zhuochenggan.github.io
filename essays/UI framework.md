*Extra Restriction And Complication On Top Of Language?* 

Frameworks are pre-developed code to provide developer convenience during software development. Matter of fact, Frameworks are widely used in the UI design and web development world. Framework itself brings many benefits to the table, such as consistency, responsive design, and time efficiency. At this point, some might ask why don’t we just use the framework for all future development since it provides so many benefits. Although the framework provides many took and pre-finished designs, this also limits the creativity of the developer. Developer are essentially limited within a frame to do their development, constantly relying on a framework are not beneficial from a learning standpoint.

*Personal Experience*

I’ve had very minimal experience with web design prior to this week, in fact, last week was my first time designing a website. I find starting with raw HTML and CSS to be very beneficial as it provides a deeper understanding of different designs. The addition of  Bootstrap 5 this week, allowed me to envision the power of the framework out there, as it was very convenient to work with, and beneficial features like icons, and a nav bar allowed me to develop a website of real-world quality.Above I have attached a picture of my replication of the Nike homepage, I had a blast designing a real-world application via a framework like Bootstrap. The simplicity of designing a website blew my mind away and it also demonstrated to me the connection of backend development vs. fronted development.
